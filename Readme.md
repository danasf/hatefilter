Hate Filter
=====
A simple experiment using a Naïve Bayes classifier to detect homophobia, other types of hate in comments, text and tweets. At the moment the corpus of training data is really small.

* This project uses Python's [NLTK](http://www.nltk.org/) and [TextBlob](http://textblob.readthedocs.org/en/latest/index.html#)
* Tutorial on building a [text classification system](http://textblob.readthedocs.org/en/latest/classifiers.html)
* Read about Naïve Bayes classifier as a tool for [spam filtering](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naive_Bayes_spam_filtering)

Contributions and ideas are welcome.
